# NodeApi

Basic API example, a little practice to understand how GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods works.

## Getting Started

This API exsample uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as a backend framework and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) library to build a Rest-API, you can see the oficial documentation for know how these work.

The DataBase manager used for this example is [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), running in localhost.

## Basic commands

Use: <br/>

- `npm install` or `npm i` to load the required libraries.
- `npm i library_name` to install an specific library.
- `npm start` to launch the app. _For this works, you must declare the "start" script in the package.json file._
- `node file_name.js` to launch an specific file.
